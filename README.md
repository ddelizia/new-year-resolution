# New year resolutions

I decided to start this repository to track the progress of my new year resolutions over the years... This is not my first time creating objectives for next year, but due to being unsuccessfully in achievin the goals set, then I decided to make it public and committing myself to achieve them. Let's see if this approach will work :D.

## Repository structure

I will create an `.md` file for each year. The file will contain the list of the objectives and its status. I will try to keep aach of the files up to date during the year.
